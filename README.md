# Teds Larger Lootpools Lite

A loot pool addon for Hideous Destructor and Ugly as Sin to add various items to Ugly as Sin's looting feature.

This is the 'Lite' fork! If you want the full version, go to [the main page](https://github.com/Gay-Snake-Squad/Teds-Larger-Lootpools)!

## Changes

The main changes in the 'lite' fork include:

- Removing most of the junk items
- Cleaning up most of the smaller and more bloaty items
- Making the experience feel less 'random' compared to the original mod.

## Requirements

- [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor)
- [Ugly as Sin](https://github.com/caligari87/Ugly-as-Sin)
